Computer Aided Diagnose System(CADS) 
Objective of the Project
The main objective of this project is to create a software system that will give 
information about the disease using the latest technology and more accurate data, in 
this we will be better with the help of highly advanced algorithm of machine learning 
and the deep neural network ,There is an effort to create a better system with the help 
of updated data.
With this help, we can treat the disease before it causes more harm.

Proposed System and Its Advantages
• Accurate information about the disease when input given by user according to the 
parameters.
• With this help, accurate information of multiple diseases will be available through 
single window system.
• Under this, all the main algorithms (ML & DL) will be used and accurate information 
will be available.
• We have also kept an option to find out the current COVID19 disease through the 
demo data for accurate information.
Note: We have created the demo data itself, keeping in mind the main parameters of 
this disease, which are being released by the scientist in research.
• We know that if the information is in the form of graphics, along with the number, it 
is better understood, that is why the information will be fully visualized.
• Along with this, this system also gives you the facility that will be able to tell that you 
have which kind of disease when the symptoms are provided.
• This system will give you all the information that is required such as
• Accuracy, precision, recall, aucroc curve, train loss, valid loss etc
• With this help, a final result can be given from the accuracy of multiple algorithms, 
which will give more accurate results.
• This system also has the feature that you can compare multiple algorithms for one data 
set and get all the necessary information.6.1Technologies
Python
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was 
initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software 
Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax 
allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code. Python is a 
programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more  CADS

efficiently. Python is an interpreter language. It means it executes the code line by line. 
Python provides a Python Shell (also known as Python Interactive Shell) which is used 
to execute a single Python command and get the result. Python Shell waits for the input 
command from the user. As soon as the user enters the command, it executes it and 
displays the result.
Anaconda (Python Distributation):
Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming 
languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, 
large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package 
management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages 
suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is developed and maintained by 
Anaconda, Inc., which was founded by Peter Wang and Travis Oliphant in 2012. As 
an Anaconda, Inc. product, it is also known as Anaconda Distribution or Anaconda 
Individual Edition, while other products from the company are Anaconda Team 
Edition and Anaconda Enterprise Edition, which are both not free.
Tensorflow :
Created by the Google Brain team, TensorFlow is an open source library for 
numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. TensorFlow bundles 
together a slew of machine learning and deep learning (aka neural networking) models 
and algorithms and makes them useful by way of a common metaphor.
